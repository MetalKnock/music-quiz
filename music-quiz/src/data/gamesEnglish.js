        "At the beginning of each game, the player shows a KAT scene in which the player’s character draws graffiti on one of the metro wagons. The hooligan notes the inspector with the dog, after which the chase begins along the railway tracks. The main goal of the game is that the player, accelerating, run as far as possible, dodging oncoming trains and other obstacles. With an increase in the acceleration of the player - it becomes more difficult to pass obstacles. If the player encounters something, then the inspector catch up with him (and regardless of how far he managed to escape) and the game ends. But this can be avoided if a surfing board was used during the collision, otherwise it is possible to spend the keys and continue the chase. ",
